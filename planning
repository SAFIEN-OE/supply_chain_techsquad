Need a way to flatten a list of risks
    - Could just recompute risk values when simulating
        - Problem: could plan for one set of risks, simulate another
    - Could output a "risk file" that lists risks for each node/edge
        - Would need to tag with a key to make sure risk file matches planning
        - Could output a "plan file" that contains both a plan and the assumptions
            that were made when generating that plan
            
    - Proposed format (JSON):
        - 
        {
            type : edge,
            id : 4,
            start : 3,
            end : 12,
            flow : 100,
            location :
                {
                    latitude : 5.00,
                    longitude : 45.00
                },
            risks : [
                {
                    type : location,
                    probability : 0.01,
                    impact : 0.75
                }
            ]
        },
        
        {
            type : node, 
            id : 12,
            location : 
                {
                    latitude : 100.003,
                    longitude : -123.89
                },
            risks : [
                {
                    type : location,
                    probability : 0.58,
                    impact : 0.5
                },
                {
                    type : type,
                    probability : 0.4,
                    impact : 1.0
                }
            ]
        }
